Reflections on Code Complete, second edition.

# 3: Upstream prerequisites
## 3.1 Importance of prerequisites
1 Software can not overcome plan flaws (“Can’t design a Pontiac and get a Rolls Royce”).
Quality at beginning (design), middle (construction) and end (testing) of process.
Planning as a form of risk reduction: The most common risks are poor planning.
Common reasons for poor planning: 

1. Inexperienced or untrained developers.
1. Unenlightened boss wants to see developers coding, because planning isn’t work. Good counter-arguments: 
  1. Simple logic - planning saves time, reduces risks, helps estimate costs
Analogy to non-software projects
Coordination between developers (UI waiting for BE on so on)
Hard data (page 29): The cost of fixing an error grows (exponentilly?) over time.
My counter-arguments:
Huge open-source projects, most notably the Kernel
“Release early” methodology

## 3.2 Determine the kind of software You’re working on
